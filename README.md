# LeetCode and HackerRank Solutions

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python%20-green.svg)

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode and HackerRank problems/challenges. 

Some of these required me to find a hint. 
Some took 5 minutes, some took 5 hours. There is always more to learn, and I am certain that many of these problems could be solved in more efficient or more elegant ways.

# Structure
Each folder (`HackerRank` and `LeetCode`) contain solutions to the problems on the respective websites. For convenience, all solutions are currently lumped into those folders, with no subfolders. Every LeetCode problem solution is prefaced by the problem number. Spaces are replaced with dashes in all problem names, and all filenames are strictly lowercase.

# File Format
All of the `.py` files contain an explanation of the solution - sometimes this is at the top of the file, and sometimes the logic is sprinkled throughout the solution in the form of comments.

All function docstrings follow the NumPyDoc format.

For HackerRank problems, *only* the solution is included - the provided routine which parses the input is not provided.
