    def maxTwoEvents(self, events: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Given a list of events, find the maximum "value" that can
        be obtained by attending at most 2 non-overlapping events

        Parameters
        ----------
        events : list[list[int]]
            events where `events[i] = [startTime, endTime, value]`
            The times are inclusive

        Returns
        -------
        m : int
            maximum value

        Notes
        -----
        - We only need to select 2 intervals, so this isn't so hard.
        - We can start with any of the intervals. WLOG, we'll use that as the
          leftmost interval. We then find the maximum of the intervals to the right, and
          that gives us our sum.
        - Since we sorted by end time, when we increase the left interval, we know the right
          interval can't move to the left at all, so we don't have to worry about the events we popped off the stack
          Those events started before the previous left ended, so they obviously start before
          the new left , since the new left event ends at least as late as the previous left event
        - We use a MaxHeap (by negating the values and feeding them to a MinHeap) to
          maintain the intervals to the right, since we sorted by end time
        - We pop items off the stack until the start is greater than the end time

        # feed into maxheap by negating the value
        # since Python's default is a minheap
        H = []  # maxheap where each event is (-value, tStart, tEnd)
        for e in events:
            e[2] *= -1  # negate for use in MaxHeap
            heappush(H, (e[2], e[0], e[1]))  # push to the heap

        # sort the events by end time
        events.sort(key=lambda e: e[1])

            # while the largest-value event starts before this event ends,
            while H and H[0][1] <= t_end:
                heappop(H)
            val += H[0][0] if H else 0
